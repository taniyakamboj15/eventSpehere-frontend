- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **State Management**: [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- **Forms**: [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) + [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
- **Routing**: [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/)
- **Maps**: [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
- **QR Codes**: [html5-qrcode](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode) & [react-qr-code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-qr-code)
- **HTTP Client**: [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd eventsphere/frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` root (optional if using default local backend):
    ```env
    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```

4.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in terminal).

## 🧪 Linting & Quality

This project uses ESLint with strict type-aware rules.
```bash
npm run lint
```

## 📝 Recent Updates

- **Architectural Cleanup**: Refactored components to separate business logic, UI styles, and type definitions.
- **Centralized Type Management**: Consolidated all component interfaces into `src/types` to ensure project-wide consistency and reusability.
- **Logic Refactoring**: Replaced complex ternary operators and conditional logic with efficient lookup maps for UI states and component styles.
- **Shared Constants**: Extracted UI variants and common styles into `src/constants/style.constants.ts` and `src/constants/button.constants.ts`.
- **Strict Type Safety**: Eliminated `any` types across critical paths and optimized component memoization.
